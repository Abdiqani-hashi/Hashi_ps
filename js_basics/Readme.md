# Javasscript

> `A computer programs` is a list of `instructions` to be    `excuted` by a computer and these programming instructions are called `statements`

> `A javascript programm` is a list of programming `statements`

***The web browser excutes js programms.***


### Javascript statements
> javascripts statements composed of :
* Values
* Operators
* Expressions
* Keywords
* Comments


### Example:
 The below code is `four` statements.
```
 let  x, y, z;
 x = 10;
 y = 20;
 z = 30;

```


This code is going to tell the browser to write "Hi,welcome" inside the html element with id =`demo`

>`document.getelementbyId("demo").innerHTML= "Hi, welcome".`

***statement are excuted one by one , in the same order as they are written.***

### Semicolons:
To seperate js statements ,we should always add semicolon at the end of each statement.

***Example***

* Declare 3 variables
* Assign the value 10 to a
* Assign the value 20 to b
* Assign the value 30 to c

```
    let a, b, c;
    a = 10,
    b = 20;
    c = 30;
```
Multiple on one line are allowed.
```
a = 10; b=20; c= a+b;
```
*Note:Ending statements with the semicolon, is not required,but it is recommended.*
*For readability purpose, it always better to avoid code lines which is longer than 80 characters.

### Code blocks
It can be groupped together in code blocks inside curly bracket{}and the reason is to define statement to be excuted together.

*Important*
> `var` is used to declare a variable.
  
> `let ` is used to declare a block variable.

>`Const` is used to declare a block constant.

> `if` is a block of statements ,which is excuted on a condition.
    `

> `which` is a block of statements, which excutes in different   case.

> `For` a block of statements to be excuted in a loop.
> `Function` is used to declare a function.
> `return` used to get out of the function.
> `try` is used to handle the error of block statements.
